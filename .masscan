This pull request copies the db_import and db_nmap related files and functions and adds capability to run masscan in the same way. Fixes #6208.

Masscan results are similar to nmap but it runs asynchronously, operating more like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap.

Homepage: https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
Tested on: Masscan 1.0.3 (Mac OS 10.10.5, Kali Linux 2.0.0 (VirtualBox VM))
Usage:

    install Masscan (comes with Kali Linux)

    modify permissions (if needed)
    I ran my msfconsole as a non-root user per the instructions for setting up a metasploit development environment, on a Kali Linux VM. On Kali Linux I couldn't run masscan as non-root, so I created a group that could run the masscan command with CAP_NET_RAW and CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities and added my user to it. I did not have to modify permissions on the Mac.

    groupadd pcap
    usermod -a -G pcap msfdev
    chgrp pcap /usr/bin/masscan
    chmod 750 /usr/bin/masscan
    setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/masscan

    run db_import with a masscan xml file or db_masscan to import masscan results into msf database

Example Output

db_masscan shows up as an option in help menu
